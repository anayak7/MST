# MST
This program performs the MST algorithm on a graph, and uses 4 different methods to do so.

# Intialize
This method is responsible for creating single rooted trees, where each tree is accompanied by a priority heap and placed into a list to perform the algorithm.

# Execute
This method simply performs the MST algorithm on the list created in the initialize method.

# Remove
Removes the item at the front of the circular linked list.

# RemoveTreeContaining
Removes the tree that contains a specific vertex.
